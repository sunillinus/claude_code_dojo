Instead, it uses a dedicated tool\ncalled **Write**. Understanding how this tool works helps you give\nbetter instructions and predict what Claude Code will do.\n\n### The Write Tool\n\nEvery file-creation request translates into a Write tool call with\ntwo required parameters:\n\n| Parameter   | Description                                  | Example                                  |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| `file_path` | The **absolute** path where the file is saved | `/Users/you/project/package.json`        |\n| `content`   | The complete text content of the file         | `{\\n  \"name\": \"my-app\"\\n}`               |\n\nThe path must be absolute (starting from the filesystem root, like\n`/Users/...` on macOS or `/home/...` on Linux). Relative paths like\n`./package.json` are not accepted by the Write tool.\n\n### Creating vs. Overwriting\n\nThe Write tool has an important behavior you need to understand:\n\n- If the file **does not exist**, Write creates it (including any\n  necessary parent directories).\n- If the file **already exists**, Write **completely overwrites** it\n  with the new content. The old content is gone.\n\nThis means that if you want to modify an existing file, Write is the\nwrong tool -- you should use Edit instead (covered in Challenge 01-003).\nClaude Code knows this rule: it will always Read a file before using\nWrite on an existing path, so it can preserve content that should not\nchange.\n\n### Why Specificity Matters\n\nClaude Code decides what to write based on your description. Compare\nthese two requests:\n\n**Vague request:**\n> \"Create a config file for my project.\"\n\nClaude Code must guess: JSON or YAML? What fields? What project name?\nThe result may not match what you wanted.\n\n**Specific request:**\n> \"Create a package.json with name 'my-api', version '1.0.0',\n> description 'REST API for user management', and a start script\n> that runs 'node server.js'.\"\n\nNow Claude Code knows exactly what to produce. Specificity saves\ntime because you avoid back-and-forth corrections.\n\n### How Claude Code Resolves Paths\n\nWhen you say \"create package.json\", Claude Code combines the current\nworking directory with your filename to form the absolute path. If\nyour working directory is `/Users/you/project`, then `package.json`\nbecomes `/Users/you/project/package.json`.\n\nYou can also specify subdirectories:\n> \"Create src/config/database.json\"\n\nClaude Code will create the `src/config/` directories if they do not\nexist, then write the file inside them.\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n```\nYou say:          \"Create package.json with name my-app\"\nClaude Code uses: Write tool\n  file_path:      /absolute/path/to/workspace/package.json\n  content:        { \"name\": \"my-app\" ... }\nResult:           New file on disk (or overwritten if it existed)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nCreate a `package.json` file for a Node.js utility library called\n`string-utils`. This is the kind of real configuration file every\nNode.js project needs.\n\nYour package.json must include ALL of the following fields:\n\n1. **name** -- set to `string-utils`\n2. **version** -- set to `1.0.0`\n3. **description** -- a meaningful description of the library\n   (not empty)\n4. **main** -- set to `index.js` (the entry point)\n5. **scripts** -- an object containing at least a `test` script\n6. **keywords** -- an array with at least two keywords\n7. **license** -- set to `MIT`\n\nThe file must be valid JSON.\n\n## Objectives\n1. Create `package.json` in the workspace root\n2. Include all 7 required fields with the correct values\n3. Bonus: Add an `author` field and a `repository` field\n"

        "content": "# Key Concepts: The Write Tool\n\n## Tool Signature\n\n```\nWrite(file_path: string, content: string)\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n1. `file_path` must be an absolute path\n2. If the file exists, it is completely overwritten\n3. Parent directories are created automatically\n4. Claude Code must Read before Write on existing files\n5. Content is written exactly as provided (no formatting changes)\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n- Creating config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, .env)\n- Scaffolding new source files\n- Generating documentation\n- Writing test files\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- Using Write to modify a single line (use Edit instead)\n- Forgetting to specify content details (leads to generic output)\n- Not specifying the filename (Claude Code must guess)\n"
