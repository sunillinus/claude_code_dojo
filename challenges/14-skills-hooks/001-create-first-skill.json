        "content": "# Challenge: Create Your First Skill\n\nLearn what skills are, how they work internally, and create one from\nscratch.\n\n---\n\n## What Is a Skill?\n\nA **skill** is a reusable prompt template that becomes a slash command\nin Claude Code. When you type `/skill-name` in a conversation, Claude\nCode loads the skill's content and uses it as instructions for handling\nyour request.\n\nThink of skills as saved prompts with superpowers:\n- They are **reusable** -- define once, invoke anywhere\n- They are **shareable** -- distribute via plugins so anyone can use them\n- They can **restrict tools** -- limit what Claude can do (covered in the\n  next challenge)\n- They can **accept arguments** -- parameterize behavior for flexibility\n\nWithout skills, you would retype the same detailed instructions every time\nyou wanted Claude to perform a specific task. With skills, you invoke\n`/review` and the full set of review instructions loads automatically.\n\n## Where Skills Live\n\nSkills live inside a plugin's `skills/` directory. Each skill gets its\nown folder containing a `SKILL.md` file:\n\n```\nmy-plugin/\n  skills/\n    review/\n      SKILL.md          <-- This IS the skill\n    changelog/\n      SKILL.md          <-- Another skill\n  plugin.json           <-- Plugin metadata\n```\n\nThe folder name becomes the slash command name. A skill in\n`skills/review/SKILL.md` is invoked as `/review`.\n\n## Anatomy of SKILL.md\n\nA skill file has two parts: optional YAML frontmatter and a markdown\nbody.\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Generate a code review checklist for any file\nallowedTools: Read, Glob, Grep\nargs:\n  - name: file\n    description: Path to the file to review\n    required: true\n---\n\nReview the file at `$ARGUMENTS` and produce a structured checklist...\n\n## Review Categories\n1. **Correctness** - Logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one errors\n2. **Security** - Input validation, injection risks, secrets exposure\n...\n```\n\n### Frontmatter Fields\n\n| Field | Required | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| `description` | Recommended | Tells Claude when to auto-trigger this skill. Also shown in the skill list so users know what it does. |\n| `allowedTools` | No | Comma-separated list of tools the skill can use. Omit for unrestricted access. |\n| `args` | No | Defines named arguments the skill accepts. Each arg has `name`, `description`, and optionally `required`. |\n\nThe `description` field serves double duty. It is displayed to users\nwhen they list available skills, AND Claude uses it to decide whether\nto automatically invoke the skill when a user's request matches.\n\n### The Markdown Body\n\nEverything below the frontmatter closing `---` is the prompt template.\nThis is what Claude receives as instructions when the skill is invoked.\nWrite it as you would write a prompt: be specific, provide structure,\ninclude examples of desired output.\n\nWhen the user invokes a skill with arguments (e.g., `/review src/app.js`),\nthe argument text is available as `$ARGUMENTS` in the body.\n\n## How Skills Are Invoked\n\nThere are three ways a skill gets activated:\n\n1. **User types the slash command**: `/review src/app.js` -- the user\n   explicitly invokes the skill\n2. **Skill tool**: Claude Code internally uses the Skill tool to invoke\n   skills programmatically\n3. **Auto-triggering**: If a skill's `description` matches the user's\n   request well enough, Claude may invoke it automatically\n\n## Skills vs. Just Typing the Prompt\n\n| Aspect | Typing a prompt | Using a skill |\n|--------|----------------|---------------|\n| Reusability | Must retype every time | Invoke with /name |\n| Consistency | Varies each time | Same instructions always |\n| Shareability | Copy-paste | Distribute via plugin |\n| Tool control | Full access always | Can restrict tools |\n| Discoverability | None | Listed in /skills |\n| Maintenance | Update everywhere | Update one file |\n\n## A Concrete Example\n\nHere is a complete skill that generates a changelog:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Generate a changelog from recent git commits\n---\n\nAnalyze the git history and generate a formatted changelog.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Run `git log --oneline -20` to see recent commits\n2. Group commits by type (feature, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)\n3. Format as a markdown changelog with sections for each type\n4. Include the commit hash (short) and message for each entry\n\n## Output Format\n```\n## [Unreleased]\n\n### Added\n- feat: description (abc1234)\n\n### Fixed\n- fix: description (def5678)\n```\n```\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nCreate a working skill that generates a **code review checklist** for\nany file. The skill should:\n\n1. Live at the correct path: `skills/review/SKILL.md`\n2. Have a meaningful `description` in the frontmatter\n3. Accept a file argument so users can invoke `/review src/app.js`\n4. Provide structured review instructions covering multiple categories\n   (correctness, security, performance, style, etc.)\n5. Define the expected output format (a checklist)\n\n## Objectives\n1. Create `skills/review/SKILL.md` with proper structure\n2. Include YAML frontmatter with a description field\n3. Include argument handling (the skill should reference the file to review)\n4. The body should contain structured review criteria and output format\n"
